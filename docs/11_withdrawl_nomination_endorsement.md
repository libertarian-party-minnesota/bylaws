### 11.1. 
A candidate’s nomination or endorsement may be withdrawn by the Executive Committee. Withdrawal of nomination or endorsement requires a two-thirds (2/3) vote of those present and voting at a meeting.

The resolution of withdrawal must state the specific reasons for withdrawal and must be signed by each member of the Executive Committee agreeing thereto.
