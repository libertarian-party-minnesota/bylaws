## 10. Nomination and Endorsement of Candidates
Candidates for federal, state, or local office may be nominated or endorsed under the methods and conditions described herein.

### 10.1. Nominations
A candidate nominated by the Libertarian Party of Minnesota for public office shall be a member of the Libertarian Party of Minnesota, shall support its platform, shall not hold a leadership position in another party’s name, and shall be its official candidate for that office in that election. A candidate who is nominated shall have expressed a willingness to accept the nomination and shall be eligible to serve in that office. Nominated candidates may also use the term “endorsed”.

### 10.2. Endorsements
Any independent candidate for elected office may be endorsed by the Libertarian Party of Minnesota if the Party has not nominated a candidate for that office in that election. A candidate who is endorsed shall be eligible to serve in that office.

### 10.3. 
Candidates may be nominated or endorsed at the annual convention under the following conditions:

1. Nomination or endorsement of candidates for federal or state offices which appear on the ballot statewide may be made only in the year of the corresponding general election.
2. All candidates seeking nomination or endorsement, shall file notice of their intent by the time established by the Convention Committee.
3. Candidates shall provide a notice of intent and written information on their qualifications, background, campaign positions, and any other information they deem relevant. The candidate shall provide a minimum of 25 copies of this information to be made available to the convention delegates. Candidates seeking nomination may be required to provide proof that they are members and a signed and dated written statement that they will support the platform.
4. Candidates or their designee shall have five minutes to address the convention before balloting takes place. No vote to nominate or endorse shall be binding unless all members of the Executive Committee have been provided with basic information on the candidate, which may include campaign literature, a campaign website, or a summary of their positions and principles, at least seven days prior to the convention.
5. Delegates shall have five minutes, or such longer time as the Chair determines, to ask questions of the candidates prior to the first ballot.
6. A paper ballot shall be prepared for the offices for which candidates have provided a notice of intent and voting shall utilize the Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) process.
7. None of the above (NOTA) shall automatically be an option on all ballots for public office. The convention may decline to nominate or endorse any candidate for public office, even if there are persons seeking nomination or endorsement for that office. Any candidate who sought endorsement at the convention and failed to achieve it, is ineligible to be nominated or endorsed by the Executive Committee, for that office in the current election cycle.
8. When two or more candidates are on the ballot for an office, during each round of the RCV process the candidate with the fewest votes shall be removed from the ballot and any ballots cast for that candidate shall then be allocated to the next choice selected on each respective ballot, if applicable. In case of a tie for last place in any round, all candidates who are tied with the fewest votes shall be eliminated.
9. If no candidate (or NOTA) has achieved the required votes for nomination or endorsement after the RCV process has been completed, no candidate shall be deemed to be nominated or endorsed for that office.

### 10.4. 
The Executive Committee may nominate or endorse candidates under the following conditions:

1. For any office having its general election in the current year, if the annual convention did not nominate or endorse a candidate for that office.
2. For any special election.
3. When the party’s nominated or endorsed candidate dies or withdraws from the race.
4. When a candidate’s nomination or endorsement is removed by the Executive Committee as provided elsewhere in these bylaws.
5. When all members of the Executive Committee have been provided with basic information on the candidate, which may include campaign literature, a campaign website, or a summary of their positions and principles, at least seven days prior to any vote.
6. Executive Committee nomination or endorsement requires a two-thirds (2/3) majority of those present and voting.

### 10.5. 
Candidates may be nominated by an affiliate under the following conditions:

1. For any office having its general election in the current year, if the annual convention or Executive Committee did not nominate a candidate for that office.
2. For any special election.
3. When the affiliate holds registered status as provided elsewhere in these Bylaws.
4. A nomination shall require at least four members present and a two-thirds (2/3) majority of those present and voting. Upon nomination by the affiliate and minutes describing the circumstances of such nomination being presented to the Party, the candidate shall automatically be considered as nominated by the Libertarian Party of Minnesota.
5. A candidate whose district transcends an affiliate’s geographic region shall not be considered nominated until all affiliates within that district concur with the nomination.
6. The Executive Committee shall retain the power to withdraw an affiliate nomination, as provided elsewhere in these Bylaws.

### 10.6. 
Nomination or endorsement of candidates shall not be refused solely because a candidate accepts money from the Minnesota Political Contribution Refund (PCR) program, the State Elections Campaign Fund, or matching funds.

### 10.7. 
Candidates nominated for Minnesota House, Minnesota Senate, US Congress, or US Senate shall pledge that, if elected, they shall not caucus with either the Democratic Party or Republican Party or otherwise align with these parties on a permanent basis. Candidates may caucus with other Libertarians or with representatives of other parties if they so choose. Candidates may vote in concert with representatives of any party on an issue-by-issue basis.
