## 3. Affiliation with the National Libertarian Party
The Libertarian Party of Minnesota shall remain affiliated with the National Libertarian Party and shall endorse their candidates as long as it and they remain consistent with the Statement of Principles.

### 3.1. 
In years when the National Libertarian Party holds its convention, the state convention shall provide for the election of delegates and alternates to represent Minnesota at the national convention up to the number of positions allowed. Such national delegates and alternates shall be current members of the Libertarian Party of Minnesota, shall be nominated from the floor at convention, and shall be elected by majority vote of the state delegates.

Each state delegate may cast a single vote for each candidate for national delegate, up to the number of positions allowed. Voting shall be by secret ballot. None of the above (NOTA) shall automatically be an option on all ballots. If NOTA is selected on a ballot, votes for other candidates on the same ballot shall be void. If total votes for NOTA exceed those of other candidates, candidates with lesser vote totals shall be deemed not elected even if obtaining a majority.
Alternates shall be allowed for up to half the number of national delegate positions available. Candidates with the most votes shall become delegates and candidates with lesser vote totals shall be deemed alternates. In the event a delegate should resign, alternates shall be called upon in the order of vote totals received.

### 3.2. 
If the Chair or Vice-Chair do not become delegates, the elected national delegates shall immediately vote to select a Delegation Chair.

### 3.3. 
In the event that national delegate or alternate positions remain vacant or if an elected delegate or alternate should resign, the Executive Committee may appoint delegates or alternates to fill the vacant position(s) by a majority vote. Such delegates or alternates shall be current members of the Libertarian Party of Minnesota. Any candidate for national delegate who sought support at the convention and failed to achieve it is ineligible to be appointed by the Executive Committee for that year.
