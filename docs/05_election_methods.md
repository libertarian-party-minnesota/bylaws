## 5. Election Methods

### 5.1. Acclamation
If there are the same number or fewer candidates in an election than there are open positions, the body may choose to dispense with the prescribed balloting process and elect said candidate(s) by acclamation. A motion to elect by acclamation requires either unanimous consent or majority vote to pass.

### 5.2. Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)
1. In an RCV election, voters will indicate a rank-order of their preferences.
2. Threshold for election.
    1. Majority – 50% of valid ballots rounding down any fraction and adding 1. (Examples: 100 Ballots, threshold is 51. 105 ballots, threshold is 53.)
    2. Two-Thirds – 2/3 of valid ballots with fractions rounded up the next whole number. (Examples: 120 Ballots, threshold is 80. 125 ballots, threshold is 82.)
3. In the first round of tabulation, ballots are allocated to the candidate marked as the first choice. If no candidate has enough ballots to reach the required threshold for victory, the candidate with the fewest votes, including None of the Above (NOTA), is eliminated and ballots previously allocated to the eliminated candidate are now allocated to the next choice selected on each respective ballot. This process repeats until one candidate has enough ballots allocated to meet or exceed the threshold for victory, or all ballots are exhausted. Ballots are exhausted if they are to be reallocated without a next choice indicated. NOTA is treated as an individual candidate under RCV procedures, to allow elimination, reallocation, and exhaustion of the ballot.
4. If NOTA should win the election, the body has the discretion to either leave the position vacant, or by majority vote, open nominations for a new election. Candidates defeated by NOTA in any previous round are not eligible for nomination in the new election.
5. If the ballots are exhausted without a winner, the body has the discretion to either leave the position vacant, or by majority vote, cast another round of RCV ballots among the remaining candidates.
6. If the threshold for victory is two-thirds, tabulation will stop if two candidates have at least one-third of the ballots allocated, making it impossible for any candidate to reach the threshold for victory.

### 5.3. Approval Voting (AV)
1. On the ballot for an AV election, voters will either indicate an “approval vote” for as many candidates as said voter would choose, or the voter may mark NOTA if they do not approve of any candidates in the election. (NOTE: A ballot with a mark for NOTA and any candidates is discarded.)
2. Candidates are elected if they meet the following three criteria:
    1. Rank in the top number of candidates for the number of open seats in terms of most approval votes received.
    2. Receive more approval votes than ballots cast for NOTA
    3. Receive an approval vote on the majority of valid ballots cast. (Majority is calculated as 50% of valid ballots rounding down any fraction and adding 1.)
3. In the event of a tie where there are fewer remaining seats than tied candidates, the body shall add one additional round of voting for the remaining candidates where voters may vote for as many candidates as there are remaining seats.
4. In the event seats remain open after a ballot, the body may open a process for new nominees, and hold another approval voting election to fill the number of remaining seats. Nominated candidates are not eligible for subsequent AV elections if they received fewer approval votes than cast for NOTA on any previous AV ballot for the office. If no further election rounds are held, these positions are deemed vacant.
