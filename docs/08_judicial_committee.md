## 8. Judicial Committee
The Judicial Committee shall be comprised of up to five members, as follows:

### 8.1. Term of Office
Judicial Committee members shall be elected for a term of 2 years.

### 8.2. Nomination and Election
Judicial Committee members shall be nominated from the floor at convention and shall be elected using the Approval Voting (AV) method. The election of 2 members shall be held in the odd numbered years, and 3 members shall be held in even numbered years. No more than 2 Executive Committee members may be members of the Judicial Committee. The members of the Judicial Committee shall select the Chair of the Judicial Committee. The newly elected members shall take office immediately upon the close of the convention. A member may serve successive terms. Judicial Committee members must be Party members for at least one year preceding their election. None of the above (NOTA) shall automatically be an option on all ballots.

In the event seats remain open after a ballot, the convention may open the floor to new nominees, and another approval voting election be held to fill the number of remaining seats. Nominated candidates are not eligible to be candidates if they received fewer approval votes than votes cast for NOTA on any ballot. If the convention declines to reopen the floor to further nominations, these seats remain unfilled.

### 8.3. 
In the event of a vacancy, the Judicial Committee shall appoint a new member to serve the remainder of the vacant position’s term.

### 8.4. 
The jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee is limited to the following matters:

1. Any challenge brought by a Party member to an Executive Committee decision alleged to be inconsistent with the Statement of Principles or the Bylaws.
2. Any challenge brought by a Party member to the validity of an Executive Committee resolution.
3. Any challenge brought by an Officer or Executive to their removal from their position.
4. Any challenge brought by a Party member to a decision not to seat them as a delegate at a state convention.
5. Any challenge brought by a Party member to the removal of an affiliate.
6. Any challenge brought by a Party member to the Executive Committee’s withdrawal of a candidate’s nomination.

### 8.6. 
The Judicial Committee may establish written Rules to govern its consideration of matters within the scope of its jurisdiction. The Rules, and any proposed changes to the Rules (including complete revocation), shall be submitted to the Executive Committee for approval, which shall be deemed given unless denied by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Executive Committee. A copy of the current Rules shall be maintained by the Secretary in the Party’s files and shall be available to any Party member. For actions which may not be governed by the Rules, Robert’s Rules of Order shall govern.
